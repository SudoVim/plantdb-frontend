# plantdb-frontend

React frontend for the plantdb application. For now, I just envision a main page that shows cards with an image per plant along with category, name, latin, tags, and description information. When you click on a card, it will take you to a page that will show you more images for that plant. On the main page, you will also be able to filter on category and tags.
